class Target(AnonymousTarget):
    """Represents a target.

    This class inherits from :class:`AnonymousTarget`.

    A target is a named unit of work that declare their file *inputs* and
    *outputs*. Target names must be valid Python identifiers.

    A script (or spec) is associated with the target. The script must be a
    valid Bash script and should produce the files declared as *outputs* and
    consume the files declared as *inputs*. Both parameters must be provided
    explicitly, even if no inputs or outputs are needed. In that case, provide
    the empty list::

        Target('Foo', inputs=[], outputs=[], options={}, working_dir='/tmp')

    The *inputs* and *outputs* arguments can either be a string, a list or
    a dictionary. If a dictionary is given, the keys act as names for the
    files. The values may be either strings or a list of strings::

        foo = Target(
            name='foo',
            inputs={'A': ['a1', 'a2'], 'B': 'b'},
            outputs={'C': ['a1b', 'a2b], 'D': 'd},
        )

    This is useful for referring the outputs of a target::

        bar = Target(
            name='bar',
            inputs=foo.outputs['C'],
            outputs='result',
        )

    The target can also specify an *options* dictionary specifying the
    resources needed to run the target. The options are consumed by the backend
    and may be ignored if the backend doesn't support a given option. For
    example, we can set the *cores* option to set the number of cores that the
    target uses::

        Target('Foo', inputs=[], outputs=[], options={'cores': 16}, working_dir='/tmp')

    To see which options are supported by your backend of choice, see the
    documentation for the backend.

    :ivar str name:
        Name of the target.

class Graph:

    The graph represents the targets present in a workflow, but also their
    dependencies and the files they provide.

    During construction of the graph the dependencies between targets are
    determined by looking at target inputs and outputs. If a target specifies a
    file as input, the file must either be provided by another target or
    already exist on disk. In case that the file is provided by another target,
    a dependency to that target will be added:

    :ivar dict dependencies:
        A dictionary mapping a target to a set of its dependencies.

    If the file is not provided by another target, the file is *unresolved*:

    :ivar set unresolved:

    :ivar dict dependents:
        A dictionary mapping a target to a set of all targets which depend on
        the target.

    The graph can be manipulated in arbitrary, diabolic ways after it has been
    constructed. Checks are only performed at construction-time, thus
    introducing e.g. a circular dependency by manipulating *dependencies* will
    not raise an exception.

    When scheduling a target, the scheduler checks whether any of its inputs
    are unresolved, meaning that during construction of the graph, no other
    target providing the file was found. This means that the file should then
    exist on disk. If it doesn't the following exception is raised:

    a target to its scheduled direct dependencies, and `reasons` is a map from
    a target to a string describing why (or why not) the target was scheduled.
