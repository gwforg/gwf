=============
API Reference
=============


The implementation of *gwf* consists of a few main abstractions. Units of work
are defined by creating :class:`~gwf.Target` instances which also define
the files used and produced by the target. A :class:`~gwf.Workflow` ties
together and allows for easy creation of targets.

When all targets have been defined on a workflow, the workflow is turned
into a :class:`~gwf.Graph` which will compute the entire dependency graph of the
workflow, checking the workflow for inconsistencies and circular dependencies.

A target in a :class:`~gwf.Graph` can be scheduled on a
:class:`~gwf.backends.Backend` using the :class:`~gwf.scheduling.submit_workflow`.
