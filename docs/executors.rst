Executors
=========

Executors are responsible for executing targets at *runtime*, that is, when the
target is being run by the backend. Executors wrap the target spec to provide
additional functionality, like 

.. automodule:: gwf.executors
   :members:
   :exclude-members: Executor
   :member-order: bysource
